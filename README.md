# Stock Market Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock market prices based on historical data. The model is implemented using Python and various libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, and Pandas.

## Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity and volatility of financial markets. In this project, we preprocess historical stock data, prepare it for training, and build an LSTM model to predict future prices. The main steps include:

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Visualizing the historical stock price trends.
- Preparing the data for time-series prediction using a sliding window approach.
- Building and training an LSTM neural network.
- Evaluating the model on unseen validation data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is normalized to improve model performance.
- **Visualization**: A line graph is used to visualize historical stock prices.
- **Sliding Window Approach**: Sequential data is divided into smaller chunks to train the LSTM model effectively.
- **LSTM Model**: A neural network architecture designed for time-series data is used for predictions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras

## Steps to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib tensorflow
   ```

3. **Download Dataset**:
   Ensure you have a stock market dataset (CSV format) with columns like `Date` and `Close`. Replace `/content/Stock_market_dataset.csv` in the code with the path to your dataset.

4. **Run the Code**:
   Execute the Python script in your preferred IDE or command line:
   ```bash
   python stock_price_prediction.py
   ```

5. **Results**:
   - The model will preprocess the data, visualize the historical prices, and train an LSTM network.
   - You can further evaluate the model and plot the predictions.

How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The data is read using Pandas, and the `Date` column is set as the index.
   - A subset of the data, focusing on the `Close` prices, is prepared for training and validation.

2. **Feature Scaling**:
   - The `Close` price values are normalized using MinMaxScaler to improve training performance.

3. **Sequence Creation**:
   - For each time step, the previous 60 data points are used as input, and the next data point is used as the target.

4. **Model Training**:
   - An LSTM model is defined, trained on the training data, and evaluated on the validation data.

Visualization Example

The project includes a plot of historical stock prices, helping users understand the trend before proceeding with model predictions.

Future Enhancements

- Add hyperparameter tuning for the LSTM model.
- Incorporate additional features like `Open`, `High`, and `Volume`.
- Test the model on different stock datasets for generalization.
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for interactive predictions.
